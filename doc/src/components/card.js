                <p>I started programming and tinkering with electronics at the age 13. Growing up reading about how entrepreneurs and engineers made an impact on the world, it became very obvious for me to thrive for the same. I think, there's no reason why someone don't. Soon, I found that if I want to create a significant impact, I need to work on technology. That reason was enough to give me a push. It took no time to be obsessed with programming, the art of creating your own tech. Since then I have been grinding my way to startup a tech company.</p>
